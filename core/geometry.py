"""Planar geometry helpers for marker-anchored pipelines.

``homography_from_aruco_pose`` builds the plane <-> image homographies for
a target plane parallel to (and optionally offset from) the marker face,
given OpenCV's ArUco PnP outputs. ``apply_homography`` /
``apply_homography_batch`` apply a 3x3 homography to one or many 2D
points. These are pure NumPy / OpenCV math with no I/O, so any
component can import them.

    OpenCV ArUco pose convention:

    Target plane (parallel to the marker face, optionally offset along
    the marker's local Z):

    A non-zero ``z_offset_m`` lifts (or lowers) the homography to a
    plane parallel to the marker — useful when the features of
    interest (e.g. the chopstick reference dots) don't lie exactly on
    the marker face. Pass the physical offset in metres; positive is
    the marker's own +Z (out of the marker face), negative is into it.
